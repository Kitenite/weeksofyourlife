# Weeks of your life

An interactive visualization of your life, week by week. I wrote about the implementation here: [petemillspaugh.com/weeks-of-your-life](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/weeks-of-your-life)

Inspired by Tim Urban's [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) (Wait But Why) and Buster Benson's [Life in Weeks](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks).
